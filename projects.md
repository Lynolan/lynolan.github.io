# Clustering-Base Tree Segmentation in Aerial Images of Orchards #
The identification of trees from aerial images is a popular topic. They are useful for quickly gathering data about trees over large distances. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) contain data about the height of a terrain, therefore, DEMs of orchards are useful for determining the growth rate of trees. This allows farmers to monitor their orchards which would allow them to customise their farming techniques according to their orchardsâ€™ needs. To identify trees in these DEMs, an image segmentation technique must be used. There are many methods available and all differ in execution time, accuracy and the type of data they are suitable for. This paper investigates the use of two such models: simple linear iterative
clustering (SLIC) and watershed segmentation when used on DEMs of orchards as well as on synthetic DEMs with the aim of understanding their viability when used together. With the use of 34 synthetic DEMs, a mean accuracy (when measured using the union over intersection calculation) of 88.16% per tree was obtained in one of the easy case DEM categories. Performance of the system ultimately depended on factors of the DEMs, such as noise, proximity of the trees to each other and the gradient of the ground.
