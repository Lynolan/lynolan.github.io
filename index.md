My name is Lynolan Moodley (just Lyn is perfectly fine). I was born in Durban, South Africa, where I attended primary andd secondary school. I then went on to complete my BSc Computer Science and Computer Games Development degree, as well as my BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree at the University of Cape Town. I am currently interning as a Backend Engineer at Aruba Networks.

I attribute many of my interests to my time at university. I enjoyed game development so much, that I continue to make computer games today. I had the opportunity to develop an interactive experience in my virtual reality course, a lightsaber (naturally). I feel there are many other uses for VR and I wish to investigate this further.

I had experience with computer vision during my honours project, [Clustering-Based Tree Segmentation in Aerial Images of Orchards](https://projects.cs.uct.ac.za/honsproj/cgi-bin/view/2020/bowden_emeruem_moodley.zip/Tree-Segmentation.html). I also completed a smaller project in HCI, with the aim of improving the public transportation system in South Africa.
